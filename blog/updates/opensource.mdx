We are proud to announce Backmesh is open source! The benefits of open source are many, but primordially we wanted to give any developer the ability to try it out Backmesh for free through our SaaS, or by self hosting it. Backmesh is hosted on Cloudflare so now anyone can host it on their own Cloudflare account without needing to use our SaaS. We should have done this from the get go, but felt like the codebase wasn’t ready yet. This led to a SaaS free tier that unfavorably impacted the bottom line making it difficult to build a sustainable business.

Today we are settings things straight. The previously free Backmesh Starter tier will now be $10/month with a 30-day free trial. The only difference between self hosting and the Backmesh SaaS will be the analytics dashboard displayed below that is not available through self hosting. All other API Proxy features are and will continue to be available in the self hosted version.

  }}
/>

We are hoping this will strengthen the LLM and Backend-as-a-Service open source ecosystems while letting us to create a healthy business that allows developers to try out Backmesh for free. Don’t forget to star us on Github!
