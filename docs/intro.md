# Intro

Backmesh is a minimal SaaS for Flutter developers to safely call private key APIs, such as OpenAI in the example below, without writing any backend code in a server or cloud function.

```dart
// Auth Provider: Firebase
// App Type: Flutter Dart
// Private Key API: OpenAI

import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import 'package:dart_openai/dart_openai.dart';


OpenAI.baseUrl =
    "https://edge.backmesh.com/appid/proxyname"; // "https://api.openai.com/v1" is the default one.
// set api secret key to jwt
OpenAI.apiKey = await FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser.getIdToken();
await OpenAI.instance.chat(...)
```

### Motivation

As of August 2024, none of the major platforms for developing Flutter apps like Supabase, Cloudflare, Vercel, or Firebase support Dart cloud functions. Additionally, many Flutter packages canâ€™t be utilized in Dart backends due to the absence of UI dependencies. As a result, Flutter developers often have to rewrite model and controller logic to handle database operations a second time in Dart, Javascript or Python. This leads to duplicated effort and a slower development process.

The primary use case for a Flutter app that requires a backend is being able to securely call an external, private key API. Backmesh allows Flutter apps to do this without a backend by storing the private API key and providing a JWT protected proxy with user-scoped access by leveraging the app's authentication provider.
