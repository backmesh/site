# Intro

Backmesh is a minimal SaaS for Flutter developers to safely call private key APIs, such as OpenAI in the example below, without writing any backend code in a server or cloud function.

```dart
// Auth Provider: Firebase
// App Type: Flutter Dart
// Private Key API: OpenAI

import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import 'package:dart_openai/dart_openai.dart';


OpenAI.baseUrl =
    "https://edge.backmesh.com/appid/proxyname"; // "https://api.openai.com/v1" is the default one.
// set api secret key to jwt
OpenAI.apiKey = await FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser.getIdToken();
await OpenAI.instance.chat(...)
```

### Motivation

Developing a Flutter app can become particularly challenging when it involves calling a private key API with backend code. As of August 2024, platforms like Supabase and Firebase do not support Dart cloud functions. Additionally, many Flutter packages canâ€™t be utilized in Dart backends due to the absence of UI dependencies.

As a result, Flutter developers often have to switch to languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python for their backend code, which means rewriting model and controller logic to handle database operations. This can increase complexity and lead to duplicated effort, making the development process less efficient.
